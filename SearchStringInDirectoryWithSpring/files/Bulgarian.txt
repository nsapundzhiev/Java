Bulgarian, along with the closely related Macedonian language (collectively forming the East 
South Slavic languages), has several characteristics that set it apart from all other Slavic
languages: changes include the elimination of case declension, the development of a suffixed
definite article (see Balkan language area), and the lack of a verb infinitive, but it retains
and has further developed the Proto-Slavic verb system. Various evidential verb forms exist
to express unwitnessed, retold, and doubtful action.
